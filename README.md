# dallas

You can clone my repo to your local and just save the file main.py and user.txt on linpy path.
./main.py will print the duplicated ID with full username lines.

print the .sh file located under linpd folder by command '#cat dupids.sh' and run first or second way to display duplicated IDs with username in linux one liner by awk.


### To run and docckerize flask app, we need some prerequsities:
  - Python3.5+ version
  - pip
  - virtualenv
Create a folder as in my case mkdir project_2501
cd myproject_2501
python3 -m venv venv

#activate virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate

// I will continue next steps within activated venv directory.
// I had created dallas repository first and clone it in activated environment 
git clone https://github.com/emre-23/dallas.git
